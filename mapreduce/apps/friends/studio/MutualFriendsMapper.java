/**
 * A {@code Mapper} for the mutual friends program. Remember the example covered
 * in the slides. Given a single user, you're creating many key-value pairs. For
 * each key-value pair, the key is an {@code OrderedPair} of the original
 * account's ID and one of their friends. The values for all of these key-value
 * pairs are the same: a list of all of the account's friends.
 * 
 * As an example, say you call the map method on account A, who is friends with
 * B, C, and D. The key-value pairs written by this method would be:
 * 
 * [((A, B), [B, C, D]), ((A, C), [B, C, D]), ((A, D), [B, C, D]))
 * 
 * Review the slides for more information.
