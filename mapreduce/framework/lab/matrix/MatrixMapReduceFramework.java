/**
 * A MapReduce framework that uses a matrix to organize its keys and associated
 * mutable containers of values. Unlike the BottleneckedMapReduceFramework, this
 * class does not require the accumulation stage to run sequentially. It gets
 * around the issue by creating a whole matrix of {@code Map}s, where each row
 * is assigned to a map task, and each column is later assigned to a reduce
 * task.
 * 
 * The {@link #mapAndAccumulateAll(Object[])} method slices up the input and
 * maps each slice to one row, accumulating as it goes. It places items into the
 * correct column based on the {@link HashUtils#toIndex(Object, int)} method.
 * Then, the {@link #combineAndFinishAll(Map[][])} method combines the mutable
 * result containers from the various map tasks, and finishes them to the
 * reduced values.
